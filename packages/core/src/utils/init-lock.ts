/**
 * Reclaimable initialization lock for isolate-lifetime singletons.
 *
 * Guards "first request initializes, everyone else waits" sections
 * (runtime creation, database init) against a workerd failure mode: if the
 * request that owns the initialization is cancelled mid-await (client
 * disconnect, context teardown), its continuation — including any `finally`
 * that would release the lock — never runs. A plain boolean or shared
 * promise then stays stuck forever and every subsequent request in the
 * isolate hangs until the platform kills it (observed as 524s at the
 * 100-second wall limit, with the isolate poisoned until eviction).
 *
 * This lock instead records *when* the owner started. Waiters poll — we
 * deliberately never await a promise created by another request, which
 * workerd flags — and if the owner has held the lock past `deadlineMs`,
 * the next waiter assumes the owner is dead, reclaims the lock, and runs
 * the initialization itself. Waiters also give up after `maxWaitMs` so a
 * request degrades to an error response rather than hanging.
